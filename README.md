# True-Fake-News-Detection


## Natural Language Processing based model which detects whether the news is true or fake.

### The model is trained on around 23500 text rows of fake data and around 21500 text rows of true data in the form of csv file.

### The model prediction accuracy is more than 0.95 .

## Applications of project:
If the model is trained on more numbers of data rows, It will be a good real-life true-fake news detector. It must contain the true and fake news of various fields in the training data set so that it can detect with great accuracy for various fields.

### This model can also predict but it is a prototype meant for learning the working of the Natural Language Processing more than the real-life application.
With the same principles applied for this project, one can build a real-life news detector if he/she has millions of rows of true/fake lines of data.
